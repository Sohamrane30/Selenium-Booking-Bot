The Selenium based bot built for Booking.com

To run the code, in your CLI:

add Selenium Driver to path => navigate to the bot-master folder => run "python main.py"

If the code does not run, changes made to the UI of booking.com may affect the performance of the bot. 
The bot is not updated regularly, hence performance may vary.
